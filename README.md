# .NET Swift interop tooling

This is a collection of tools designed to consume a compiled Apple Swift library and generate bindings and wrappers that enable it to be used as a .NET library.

## Current Status

The components are currently undergoing iterative reviews and will be moved from https://github.com/xamarin/binding-tools-for-swift.
