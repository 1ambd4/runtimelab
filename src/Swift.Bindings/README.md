# Swift bindings (Experimental)

**WARNING**: This package is currently in an experimental phase.


This is a set of tools that can consume a compiled Apple Swift library and generates C# bindings that allow it to be surfaced as a .NET library.

## Usage

The tooling consumes Swift ABI files, which are generated from `.swiftinterface` files by the Swift compiler. This ABI file contains a json representation of the abstract syntax tree of the `.swiftinterface` file. The `.swiftinterface` and `.abi.json` files are generated by executing the `swiftc` command with the `-emit-module-interface` option.

```
Description:
  Swift bindings generator.

Usage:
  SwiftBindings [options]

Options:
  -a, --swiftabi <swiftabi> (REQUIRED)  Path to the Swift ABI file.
  -o, --output <output> (REQUIRED)      Output directory for generated bindings.
  -v, --verbose <verbose>               Prints information about work in process.
  -h, --help                            Display a help message.
  --version                             Show version information
  -?, -h, --help                        Show help and usage information
```

It is possible to specify multiple Swift ABI files for processing. If a unsupported type is encountered, the tooling will ignore it and generate C# source code for known syntax.
